# Laboratory Activity 3 & 4 - CS-1202 - Tool
This program simulates a virtual toolbox where the user can manage various tool. Each tool has specific features, such as durability, and the ability to be used, repaired, or modified. 

üõ†Ô∏è Toolmaster: Workshop Simulator

Toolmaster: Workshop Simulator is a console-based application designed to demonstrate key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using a collection of virtual tools. This interactive program allows users to manage and utilize various tools, each with unique functionalities and realistic durability mechanics in a simulated workshop environment.

‚ùì What is Toolmaster?

Toolmaster serves as a comprehensive workshop simulator where users can explore the use and maintenance of different tools. The program emphasizes OOP concepts, offering functionalities such as using tools, replacing components, and repairing worn-out equipment.

üîß Core Features:

    - Interactive Workshop Menu: Navigate through various tools and select actions like using, repairing, or inspecting tools.
    - Realistic Durability Mechanics: Tools degrade with each use, requiring repairs to restore them to peak condition.
    - Customizable Components: Swap out saw blades or drill bits to adapt tools for specific tasks.

üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools and Their Functions:

    - Hammer: Strike and remove nails, with each strike randomly affecting nail depth.
    - Drill: Drill holes at variable speeds, change drill bits for different materials.
    - Saw: Cut through wood using different blade types, each suited for specific materials.
    - Measuring Tape: Measure wood lengths and mark intervals at user-defined distances.
    - Wrench: Tighten or loosen bolts with adjustable sizes; includes torque control.
    - Screwdriver: Tighten or loosen screws, change tip types (Flathead, Phillips, Torx), and toggle magnetization.


üì¶ Key OOP Concepts Implemented:

    - Inheritance: The Tool superclass defines core attributes and methods, extended by each tool type.
    - Polymorphism: Each tool type implements its own use() method, showcasing different behaviors.
    - Encapsulation: Tool attributes are managed internally, with controlled access through methods.
    - Abstraction: Essential tool behaviors are defined as abstract methods, ensuring consistency across tools.
